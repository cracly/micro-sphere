The apparent temperatures, which account for wind chill, will range from <strong>5.9\u00b0C</strong> to <strong>12.5\u00b0C</strong>. This means that while the actual temperature will be comfortable for most outdoor activities, the wind chill will make it feel cooler, especially in the early morning and late evening.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Wind Conditions</h3>\n<p>\n    The average wind speed will be <strong>13.4 km/h</strong>, with a maximum wind speed of <strong>17.2 km/h</strong> and gusts reaching up to <strong>43.2 km/h</strong>. The wind direction will generally be from the northwest, shifting slightly throughout the day. Stronger winds and gusts could affect activities like cycling, sailing, or any sport that involves maintaining balance or direction.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Precipitation & Humidity</h3>\n<p>\n    There will be minimal precipitation, with a total of <strong>0.5 mm</strong> expected. The maximum precipitation probability is <strong>85%</strong> early in the morning, but it will quickly drop to 0% by mid-morning. The average humidity will be <strong>58.0%</strong>, which is comfortable for most outdoor activities.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Sun & UV</h3>\n<p>\n    The maximum UV index will reach <strong>5.95</strong>, indicating moderate UV levels. This means that sun protection, such as sunscreen and hats, will be necessary for prolonged outdoor activities. The total sunshine duration will be <strong>9.0 hours</strong>, with the sun being most intense between 12:00 and 15:00.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Visibility & Cloud Cover</h3>\n<p>\n    Visibility will be good, with an average of <strong>62.8 km</strong>. Cloud cover will be high throughout the day, ranging from <strong>70%</strong> to <strong>100%</strong>, which may affect visibility slightly but will not significantly impact outdoor activities.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Weather Patterns and Transitions</h3>\n<p>\n    The day will start with overcast conditions and a chance of light precipitation, with temperatures around <strong>11.4\u00b0C</strong>. As the day progresses, the temperature will gradually rise, peaking at <strong>15.7\u00b0C</strong> around 18:00. The wind will be strongest in the early morning and mid-afternoon, with gusts that could affect outdoor activities. The UV index will be highest between 12:00 and 15:00, requiring sun protection during this period.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Implications for Outdoor Sports Activities</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Morning Activities:</strong> Early morning activities may feel cooler due to the wind chill, and there is a chance of light precipitation. Activities like running or cycling may require additional layers.</li>\n    <li><strong>Mid-Morning to Afternoon:</strong> This period will be ideal for most outdoor activities, with temperatures rising and wind speeds moderating. However, the UV index will be high, so sun protection is essential.</li>\n    <li><strong>Late Afternoon to Evening:</strong> Temperatures will remain comfortable, but the wind may pick up again, affecting activities that require stability or direction.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\n    The best time window for outdoor activities will be from <strong>10:00 to 16:00</strong>, when temperatures are comfortable, wind speeds are moderate, and the UV index is at its peak, allowing for optimal outdoor enjoyment with proper sun protection.\n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```"
